# Microsoft OneDrive integration into Nextcloud

[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/nextcloud/integration_onedrive)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/nextcloud/integration_onedrive)

üóî OneDrive integration allows you to automatically import your files into Nextcloud.

**Note: This app does not work with OneDrive for Business**

### User settings

The account configuration and data migration happen in the "Data migration" user settings section.

### Admin settings

There also is a "Connected accounts" **admin** settings section that you must visit to configure a Microsoft Azure OAuth app to allow your Nextcloud users to authenticate to Microsoft services.

## **üõ†Ô∏è State of maintenance**

While there are many things that could be done to further improve this app, the app is currently maintained with **limited effort**. This means:

- The main functionality works for the majority of the use cases
- We will ensure that the app will continue to work like this for future releases and we will fix bugs that we classify as 'critical'
- We will not invest further development resources ourselves in advancing the app with new features
- We do review and enthusiastically welcome community PR's

We would be more than excited if you would like to collaborate with us. We will merge pull requests for new features and fixes. We also would love to welcome co-maintainers.

If there is a strong business case for any development of this app, we will consider your wishes for our roadmap. Please [contact your account manager](https://nextcloud.com/enterprise/) to talk about the possibilities.
