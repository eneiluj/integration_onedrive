# Microsoft OneDrive integration into Nextcloud

ðŸ—” OneDrive integration allows you to automatically import your files into Nextcloud.

### User settings

The account configuration happens in the "Data migration" user settings section.

A link to the "Data migration" user settings section will be displayed in the widget for users who didn't configure a Microsoft account.

### Admin settings

There also is a "Connected accounts" **admin** settings section that you must visit to configure a Microsoft Azure OAuth app to allow your Nextcloud users to authenticate to Microsoft services.
